  Botball is a compteition that my school's robotics team participates in every year. The premise is to build and code two robots that will do tasks to get the most points in a set amount of time. I usually help with the engineering portion but for my last year on the team I coded one of the robots. For my code I mostly used sensors but I had a hard coded version in case something went wrong. We were the only team that got the potato and put the fries in the bag.
